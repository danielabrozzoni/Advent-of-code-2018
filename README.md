# Advent of code 2018

These are my solutions for AOC 2018!

I decided to solve these problems in Python: I haven't mastered it yet, so I thought this kind of problems could be useful to improve my pythonic skills üêç - for this reason, probably you'll find tons of errors or unpythonic code: please, whenever you see something _strange_, open a issue/PR!
